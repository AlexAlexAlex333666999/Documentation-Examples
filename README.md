# Uxcel Voice and Tone Guidelines
For [Uxcel](https://uxcel.com/), an e-learning project, I developed voice and tone guidelines that illustrate the way the product talks with its users. I canâ€™t share the final version of the document because of the NDA, but you can find one of the first drafts [here](https://github.com/AlexAlexAlex333666999/Documentation-Examples/blob/Uxcel-Voice-and-Tone-Guidelines/Uxcel%20Voice%20%26%20Tone.pdf).
