# Adform API Help Center Re-Structure
For [Adform](https://site.adform.com/), a Nordic AdTech company, I lead a project for re-structuring the content of the API help center. The work included:
- Designing a new content structure 
- Writing new guides according to user journeys
- Getting rid of an outdate information
- Introducing release notes and deprecation schedule

The re-structured help center is still available for public via [this URL](https://api.adform.com/help/).
