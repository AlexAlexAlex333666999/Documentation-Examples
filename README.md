# ‘How to Launch a Satellite’ Project
**How to Launch a Satellite** was a final project for the Professional Technical Writing course at the University of Washington. The project included not only providing a final deliverable—a short video in this case—but walking through a whole cycle of project planning and audience analysis.
Since we split the workload among five people, I provide only those docs that I was responsible for, which include:
- [Audience Interview Insights](https://github.com/AlexAlexAlex333666999/Documentation-Examples/blob/'How-to-Launch-a-Satellite'-Project/Interview%20Insights.pdf)
- [User Empathy Map](https://github.com/AlexAlexAlex333666999/Documentation-Examples/blob/'How-to-Launch-a-Satellite'-Project/AFKG5-Empathy-Map.pdf)
- [Video itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAWpfQfrD3c) where I was responsible for the production and editing
