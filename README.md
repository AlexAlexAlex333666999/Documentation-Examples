# API-NBA Integration Guide
I wrote [this guide](https://github.com/AlexAlexAlex333666999/Documentation-Examples/blob/API-NBA-Integration-Guide/Moroz%20API-NBA%20Integration.pdf) as a part of the Professional Technical Writing course at the University of Washington. This document describes the steps required for integration with API-NBA, an open source solution from the [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba) hub.
